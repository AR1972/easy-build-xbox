# Easy-Build for XBOX Original



**What is it?**

A tool in testing for compiling xbox code.

- Windows 7 -10 x86 required

- Fixed issues with mstools/idw folders incorrectly being set

- Basic Options for compiling

**What's Updated?**

- Separated easybuild.cmd (mainmenu) to public/tools/ 
- Added xcopybins.cmd (basic, needing love, has pauses to tell us what's going down)
- Actual easybuild.cmd shows correct Razzle Tool Path now, starts xcopybins.cmd as postbuild

  **NOTE: This is the first release, It is lacking in many features that Easy-Build-NT5 has.. If I get time I will eventually figure out more of the build system**
